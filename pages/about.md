  and 8206(e)).

#### Correcting a Notarial Act

"There are no provisions in the law that allow for the correction of a completed notarial act. If a notary public discovers an error in a notarial act after completing the act, then the notary public should notarize the signature on the document again. All requirements for notarization are required for the new notarial act, including  completing and attaching a new certificate containing the date of the new notarial act and completing a new journal entry."
