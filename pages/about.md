#### Methods of Identification

#### Certified Copies

Certifed Copies
A notary public may only certify copies of powers of attorney under Probate Code section
4307 and his or her notary public journal. (Government Code sections 8205(a)(4), 8205(b)(1),
and 8206(e))
Certifed copies of birth, fetal death, death, and marriage records may be made only by the
State Registrar, by duly appointed and acting local registrars during their term of offce, and
by county recorders. (Health & Safety Code section 103545)

#### Correcting a Notarial Act

There are no provisions in the law that allow for the correction of a completed notarial act.
If a notary public discovers an error in a notarial act after completing the act, then the notary public should notarize the signature on the document again. All requirements for notarization are required for the new notarial act, including completing and attaching a new certificate containing the date of the new notarial act and completing a new journal entry.
