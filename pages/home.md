# Thank you for visiting my site.

My name is Kailyn Elizabeth Bridwell. I am a California Notary Public. Please have a look through my website to learn a little more about me.





### I am not an attorney.

### I cannot prepare, draft, select, or make any determination regarding any legal documents.

### I cannot give advice in relation to any legal documents or matters.

[The California courts have an excellent tool to assist with finding you a lawyer](https://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-findlawyer.htm?rdeLocaleAttr=en), if that is what you need. 

> "California notaries public are **prohibited** from performing any duties that may be construed as the practice of law. 
>
> Among the acts which constitute the practice of law are the preparation, drafting, or selection or determination of the kind of any legal document, or giving advice in relation to any legal documents or matters. If asked to perform such tasks, a California notary public should decline and refer the requester to an attorney."
