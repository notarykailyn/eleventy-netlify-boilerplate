#### My name is Kailyn Elizabeth Bridwell. I am a California Notary Public. Please have a look through my website to learn a little more about me.

> "California notaries public are prohibited from performing any duties that may be construed as the practice of law. 
>
> Among the acts which constitute the practice of law are the preparation, drafting, or selection or determination of the kind of any legal document, or giving advice in relation to any legal documents or matters. If asked to perform such tasks, a California notary public should decline and refer the requester to an attorney." 
>
> *Notary Public Handbook*, California Secretary of State (2021).  

##### I am not an attorney.

##### I cannot prepare, draft, select, or make any determination regarding any legal documents.

##### I cannot give advice in relation to any legal documents or matters.
